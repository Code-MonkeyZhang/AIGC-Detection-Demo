## Overview

The **[AI-Generated Image Detection Model](https://sightengine.com/detect-ai-generated-images)** can help you determine if an image was entirely generated by an AI model, or if it is a real image. This model was trained on millions of artificially-created and human-created images spanning all sorts of content such as photography, art, drawings, memes and more.

The Model works by analyzing the visual (pixel) content of the image. No meta-data is used in the analysis. Tampering with meta-data such as EXIF data therefore has no effect on the scoring.

The Model was trained to detect images generated by the main models currently in use: GPT-4o, Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion XL, MidJourney, Adobe Firefly, Flux, Reve, Recraft, Imagen, Ideogram, GANs... Additional models will be added over time as they become available.

### Use cases

- Tag AI-generated imagery as such, to limit the spread of misinformation and fake news
- Implement stricter moderation rules on AI-generated imagery
- Detect potential fraud with fake ids, fake profiles or fake claims
- Limit ai-generated spam
- Enact bans on AI-generated imagery

### Related model

The following 3 models can provide a useful complement to the AI-generated image detection model:

- [Deepfake Detection](https://sightengine.com/docs/deepfake-detection): Detect swapped or modified faces.
- [Type Detection](https://sightengine.com/docs/illustration-photo-detection): Detect if an image is a photography or an illustration.
- [AI Video Detection](https://sightengine.com/docs/ai-generated-video-detection): Detect AI-generated videos.

### Detect if an image was AI-generated

Let's say you want to check the following image:

![](https://sightengine.com/assets/img/examples/example-prop-c2.jpg)

You can either send the image URL, or upload the raw binary image.

#### Option 1: Send image URL

Here's how to proceed if you choose to share the image URL:

curlpythonphpnodejs

```

curl -X GET -G 'https://api.sightengine.com/1.0/check.json' \
    -d 'models=genai' \
    -d 'api_user={api_user}&api_secret={api_secret}' \
    --data-urlencode 'url=https://sightengine.com/assets/img/examples/example-prop-c1.jpg'

```

[See request parameter description](https://sightengine.com/docs/ai-generated-image-detection#d)

#### Option 2: Send raw image

Here's how to proceed if you choose to upload the raw image:

curlpythonphpnodejs

```

curl -X POST 'https://api.sightengine.com/1.0/check.json' \
    -F 'media=@/path/to/image.jpg' \
    -F 'models=genai' \
    -F 'api_user={api_user}' \
    -F 'api_secret={api_secret}'

```

[See request parameter description](https://sightengine.com/docs/ai-generated-image-detection#d)

#### Response

The API will then return a JSON response with the **ai_generated** score. This score is a float between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the higher the confidence that the image is AI-generated:

```
